# Intro

I have worked on CapGes from September of 2020 until present. An important part of this project is downloading the files that contain the data. I will work on a project that find these files, analyzes if they are the correct file, and downloads them.


# Proposal

## Create a 'Search Engine' 
- Automate the process of downloading files from the web. It will do the following steps:

  - Open mutual fund company landing pages and search the html code for urls using keywords
  - Download pdf files, or images of the html, extract and interpret text to discern if the pages contain up to date capital gains estimate data
  - Calculate the accuracy of the search engine
