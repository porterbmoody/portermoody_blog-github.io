# Intro

I have worked on CapGes from September of 2020 until present. Here are some things I plan to do for my senior project:
- Increase accuracy of pdf url finder amidst hundreds of lines of html code. 
- Create various data formatting functions. 
- Create many 'truth data' tables to assess where the parser is currently at. 


# Proposal

- Class shape the long/wide format
- write regex patterns to find certain urls. Write function to score accuracy of the urls
- condense multiple NAV columns into 1 single column
