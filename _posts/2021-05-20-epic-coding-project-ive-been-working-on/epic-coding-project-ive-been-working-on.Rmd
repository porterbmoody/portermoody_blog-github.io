Python is a neat tool for creating machine learning algorithms. Pandas is a helpful package when doing anything data science in python. Lately I've been hustling to get this project up at running at a decent accuracy. What is this project? It a big web data acquisition and formatting project. We're creating an algorithm to scrape the web for files, extract tables from them and store them into a database. 

It's for a pdf like this:
